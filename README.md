# workflow

This is just a simple note on how I take notes while working for the purposes of record keeping,
for showing myself and others what I've done, what worked, didn't work, etc.

## Quick-start

1. Make a new local git repository.

   ```
   mkdir workflow
   cd workflow
   git init
   ```

2. Make a remote GitHub repository.

   In your browser, go to [github.com][], login, click the `+` icon on the top right and select "New repository."
   Give it a name, description, make it public or private and click the green button to create the remote repository.
   
3. Link the remote and local repository.

   After creating a new repository, you'll see a bunch of suggested ways to set it up.
   Copy the stuff in the section "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line."
   In the terminal window, at the command line, paste the stuff you just copied.   
   
4. Create a README.md file for keeping notes. In the terminal, in the new repository directory, enter

   ```
   emacs README.md
   ```

5. Make some notes.

   In Emacs, edit the README.md file using the markdown markup language.
   
   If you don't know about Markdown, see [Markdown](#markdown)
   
6. Commit and push your notes to the cloud *from within Emacs*!

   Save your work frequently!  In Emacs, type `C-x C-s`.
   
   Use [magit](#magit) to commit changes to the local repository and push the changes to the remote (GitHub) repo as well.
   
   If you don't know about magit, see the [magit](#magit) section below.


## More details
   
### Magit
   
Magit is an Emacs package that enables you to invoke git commands from within your Emacs session.
This saves you a lot of time, hassle, and keystrokes.
Because it incorporates git seamlessly into Emacs, `magit` promotes the habit of making many small, frequent git commits;
this in turn helps keep your repositories up-to-date.

#### Install Magit

Here are two ways to install the `magit` Emacs package. (Only do one of these.)

1.  * In Emacs, type `M-x`.
    * In the mini-buffer that appears at the bottom of the Emacs window, type `package-list-packages` and hit `Enter`.
    * In the Emacs buffer listing the available and installed packages, search for `magit` (using `C-s magit`).
    * With the cursor on the line showing the main `magit` package, type `i` (for install).
    * Type `x` to proceed with the install.

OR

2.  * In Emacs, type `M-x`.
    * In the mini-buffer that appears at the bottom of the Emacs window, type `package-install` and hit `Enter`.
    * In the mini-buffer, type `magit` and hit `Enter`.

#### Using magit

1.  After you make some changes to your emacs file that you want to commit to your repository, type `M-x magit`
    This should spawn a new Emacs buffer window showing you the status of your local repository.

2.  Move the cursor to the line of a file in the "Unstaged changes" section and type `s` (for "stage").
    If you want to stage all the files listed in the "Unstaged changes" section type `S` (for "stage all").
    
3.  Type `cc` (for "commit").  This will bring up a new buffer where you can insert a new commit message.

4.  Type a commit message and then type `C-c C-c`.



### Markdown

Markdown is a nice and easy markup language that's useful for quickly typesetting notes, small documents, and 
web page content in a way that looks quite nice on web pages served by sites (like [GitHub.com][])
that know how to process and typeset markdown files.

Markdown is *very* easy to learn and, even if you don't know it yet, you can begin writing nice 
Markdown files in a matter of minutes.

There are many resources on the web that teach you how to do this. Here are some
examples that a quick Google search turns up: [markdowntutorial.com][] or [markdownguide.org][].
